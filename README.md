# Dracilious
The Mojo app consumming [DracPerl::Client](https://github.com/apcros/Drac-Perl) to provide a faster and cleaner front-end for Dell server monitoring

## How to use ? 

Currently you need to symlink the lib from Drac-Perl in my Github. (I need to dzil that module so that you can install it via Pinto, or better putting it on cpan.)
You also need to go put your crendentials in the modules.

Dracilious is still very much WIP.
